# Day 1 â€“ Git Refresher Notes

Today I practiced:

- Initializing a Git repository
- Creating and working in a feature branch
- Writing clear commit messages
- Pushing to GitHub
- Creating and merging pull requests

This workflow matches how real software teams collaborate and helps maintain a clean Git history.
